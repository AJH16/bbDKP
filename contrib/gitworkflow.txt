Git standard workflow
---------------------

1) make feature branch1 in your fork.
2) commit to branch1. 
3) once done, rebase the commits in branch1 (git rebase -i HEAD~n) where n is the number of commits in your branch. 
4) push branch1 to Github
5) create a PR to bbDKP/bbDKP v130


Git alternate workflow if you pushed branch1 before doing a rebase. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) make feature branch1 in your fork.
2) commit to branch1. 
3) push these commits
4) once done, create and checkout branch2 from branch1
5) rebase the commits in branch2 (git rebase -i HEAD~n) where n is the number of commits in your branch. 
6) push branch2 to Github
7) create a PR to bbDKP/bbDKP v130
8) delete branch1
